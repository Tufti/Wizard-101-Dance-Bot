# Wizard-101-Dance-Bot
A bot that automatically does the dancing pet minigame in Wizard101

Instructions for use:
- Put the client in windowed mode, 800x600
- Go to pet pavilion and stand in front of the minigame circle so the prompt to press X is displayed
- Run the script, a box will come up asking for your current energy and will play that many games divided by 8 (eg. you only want it to play 5 games type "40" into the box)
- Press "OK" and leave your computer running, should work fine so long as you don't touch your mouse or keyboard
- If the script does mess up (will usually leave you on the dance screen and not input anything), find the script in task manager and end it then relaunch the script
